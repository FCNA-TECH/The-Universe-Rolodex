# The-Universe-Rolodex
This project is my first introduction into Object Oriented Programming and is a simple programme that displays info of the different galaxies and planets and stars.
The name Rolodex was inspired by the netflix show "The Brothers Sun" i recommend it as its very good.

To download and use this project, Download all files (Program, Celestial Body, Galaxy, Star, Planet and Moon .cs files) all into the same folder and then run the Program file.

The Oject Oriented Programming Techniques i used in this project:
- Inheritence
- Constructors
- Instantiation
- Protected properties
- Public Methods
